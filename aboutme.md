I am a **PhD student** at PSG College of Technology and also working as Assistant Professor in the same college. My areas of interest include Machine Learning, Image Processing and Digital Forensics. Currently working on projects related with **_Medical Image Analysis_**.

I would like to contribute to Open source projects.

I am happy to collaborate. Drop in a mail, if you think we can collaborate on projects.
